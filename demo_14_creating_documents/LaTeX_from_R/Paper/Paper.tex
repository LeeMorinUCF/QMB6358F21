\section{Sample Document}

This is a sample of a document generated automatically from the figures and tables produced by
the script that was used to read in and analyze data.
First, in Section \ref{sec:data}, it describes the data.
Next, in Section \ref{sec:results}, it describes the results of the estimated regression model.

\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

Summary statistics for numerical variables are shown in Table \ref{tab:summary} (all figures in millions).

\input{../Tables/summary.tex}


Table \ref{tab:earthquakes} shows the frequency of observations in and out of California along with the incidence of earthquakes. Notice that earthquakes have only happened in California.

\input{../Tables/earthquakes.tex}

The correlation matrix of potential variables in the model is shown in Table \ref{tab:corr}.
House prices are positively correlated with income and California but negatively correlated with earthquakes. In the next setion, these variables will be included in a regression model.

\input{../Tables/correlation.tex}

\section{Empirical Results}  \label{sec:results}


The estimates from the regression model are shown in Table \ref{tab:lm_model_1}.
\input{../Tables/lm_model_1.tex}

\input{../Text/regression.tex}




\pagebreak
The regression lines are shown in Figure \ref{fig:reg}, with the estimated intercept term for zip codes affected by earthquakes (red), those in the rest of California (green), and the zip codes outside of California.

\label{fig:reg}
\end{figure}


\pagebreak
The predictions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pred} compared to observed prices.
It is clear that there is a reasonably close relationship between the predictions and the observed prices.
